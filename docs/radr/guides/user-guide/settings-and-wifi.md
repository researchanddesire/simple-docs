## WiFi Configuration

WiFi connectivity enables over-the-air (OTA) firmware updates for your RADR.

!!! info
    WiFi is optional and primarily used for firmware updates. RADR's core functionality (device control) works entirely over Bluetooth.

### Setting Up WiFi

### Step 1: Open WiFi Settings

From the settings menu, select **WiFi Settings**.

### Step 2: Connect to RADR's Access Point

RADR creates a WiFi access point called **"RADR Setup"**.

A QR code is displayed on screen for easy connection:

```
WIFI:S:RADR Setup;T:nopass;;
```

Scan the QR code with your phone, or manually connect to the network:
- **Network Name:** RADR Setup
- **Password:** None (open network)

### Step 3: Configure WiFi Credentials

Once connected to RADR's access point, a configuration portal opens automatically:

1. Select your home WiFi network from the list
2. Enter your WiFi password
3. Save the configuration

### Step 4: Confirmation

After successful configuration, you'll see the **"WiFi Connected"** screen:

- **Message:** "Your OSSM Remote is now connected to WiFi."
- RADR is now ready to receive OTA updates

### WiFi Configuration Details

| Parameter | Value |
|-----------|-------|
| Access Point Name | RADR Setup |
| Security | Open (no password) |
| Portal Timeout | 30 seconds |
| Retry Attempts | 5 |

!!! warning
    The WiFi setup portal has a 30-second timeout. If the portal times out, restart the WiFi Settings process.

## Update Device

Select **Update Device** to check for and install firmware updates.

!!! note
    This feature requires WiFi to be configured. Updates are downloaded and installed over-the-air.

## Restart Device

Select **Restart Device** to reboot your RADR. This is useful for:

- Clearing temporary issues
- Applying certain settings changes
- Resetting the Bluetooth state

The device will power off and restart automatically.

## Sleep Mode

From the main menu, select **Sleep** to enter deep sleep mode.

### What Happens in Sleep Mode

1. RADR disconnects any connected devices
2. A shutdown sound plays
3. The display turns off
4. LEDs turn off
5. The device enters ultra-low power mode

### Waking from Sleep

Press any of the three under-screen buttons to wake RADR:

- Left button
- Middle button
- Right button

!!! info
    When waking from sleep, RADR performs a full restart and returns to the main menu.

### When to Use Sleep Mode

Use sleep mode when:

- You're done using RADR but don't want to fully power off
- You want to conserve battery between sessions
- You want a quick way to pause without disconnecting the power switch

!!! tip
    For extended storage, use the physical power switch instead of sleep mode. Sleep mode still consumes minimal power.

## Power Management Summary

| Method | Battery Usage | Wake Method |
|--------|---------------|-------------|
| Active (connected) | High | N/A |
| Active (idle) | Medium | N/A |
| Sleep Mode | Very Low | Under-screen button |
| Power Switch Off | None | Power switch |
