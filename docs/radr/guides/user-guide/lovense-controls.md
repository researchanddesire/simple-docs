RADR supports Lovense Bluetooth devices with a simplified vibration-only control interface. This guide covers how to control Lovense devices.

!!! note
RADR provides **vibration-only** control for Lovense devices. Advanced features like heating, rotation, or device-specific patterns are not currently supported.

## Supported Lovense Devices

RADR has been tested with the following Lovense devices:

| Device | Status |
|--------|--------|
| Lovense Domi | Tested |
| Lovense Hyphy | Tested |
| Lovense Ferri | Tested |

Many other Lovense devices are supported but untested. See [Device Support](../reference/device-support) for the complete list.

## Control Screen Overview

When connected to a Lovense device, the control screen is simpler than the OSSM interface:

- **Left Encoder Dial:** Vibration intensity control
- **Center Button:** STOP button
- **Display:** Shows vibration level and device status

## Vibration Control

The **left encoder** controls vibration intensity.

| Parameter | Range | Default |
|-----------|-------|---------|
| Vibrate | 0–16 | 0 |

- Turn clockwise to increase intensity
- Turn counter-clockwise to decrease intensity
- Setting to 0 stops vibration

!!! info
Lovense devices use a 0–16 intensity scale, not percentage. Level 16 is maximum intensity.

## Stop Button

The **middle button** acts as an immediate stop:

- Press to set vibration to 0
- The device stops vibrating immediately

Unlike the OSSM, there's no pause/resume state—simply increase the vibration level to restart.

!!! info
For reliability, RADR sends the stop command twice with a brief delay. This ensures the command is received even if the first transmission is lost due to Bluetooth interference.

## Battery Level

For Lovense Domi (and Domi 2), RADR can query the device's battery level via its direct integration:

- Battery percentage is shown on screen
- Check battery status before sessions to avoid interruptions

!!! note
Battery level is available for Domi devices via direct Bluetooth integration. Other Lovense devices may or may not support battery level reporting depending on their Buttplug.io implementation.

## Connecting to Lovense Devices


### Step 1: Prepare your Lovense device


Turn on your Lovense device. Ensure the Lovense app is **closed** on your phone—only one controller can connect at a time.

### Step 2: Scan with RADR


Turn on RADR or select **Device Search** from the main menu. RADR scans for 5 seconds.

### Step 3: Select your device


Your Lovense device appears in the device list. Select it with the right button to connect.

### Step 4: Start controlling


Once connected, use the left encoder to control vibration intensity.

!!! warning
Close the Lovense phone app before connecting with RADR. Bluetooth devices can only have one active controller.

## Limitations vs Native App

RADR provides basic vibration control. The following features are **not** available:

| Feature | RADR | Lovense App |
|---------|------|-------------|
| Basic vibration | Yes | Yes |
| Vibration patterns | No | Yes |
| Remote partner control | No | Yes |
| Sound-reactive modes | No | Yes |
| Alarm features | No | Yes |
| Device settings | No | Yes |
| Firmware updates | No | Yes |

!!! tip
Use RADR when you want tactile, physical controls without a phone. Use the Lovense app for advanced features and remote play.

## Troubleshooting

<AccordionGroup>
??? note "Lovense device doesn't appear in scan"

- Ensure the device is powered on (LED blinking)
- Close the Lovense phone app completely
- Move RADR within 1–2 meters of the device
- Power-cycle both devices and retry

??? note "Device connects but doesn't vibrate"

- Ensure vibration level is above 0
- Check that the device has battery charge
- Some devices need a few seconds after connection to initialize

??? note "Vibration is inconsistent"

- Reduce distance between RADR and the device
- Move away from WiFi routers and other Bluetooth devices
- Ensure no other apps are trying to connect

## Tips

!!! tip
Start at a low intensity level (2–4) and gradually increase to find your preferred setting.

!!! tip
The encoder provides quick access to all 17 levels (0–16). You can rapidly scroll through intensities.
