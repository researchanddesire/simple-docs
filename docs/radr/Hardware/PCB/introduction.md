## Core Components

### Microcontroller

| Parameter | Value |
|-----------|-------|
| MCU | ESP32-S3 |
| Memory | Includes PSRAM |
| Wireless | WiFi + Bluetooth LE |
| Operating Voltage | 3.3V |

The ESP32-S3 provides:
- Dual-core Xtensa LX7 processor
- Integrated Bluetooth Low Energy for device communication
- Sufficient GPIO for all inputs, outputs, and peripherals
- Low-power sleep modes for battery conservation

### Power Management

| Component | Function |
|-----------|----------|
| USB-C Connector | 5V charging input |
| Charging IC | LiPo battery charging |
| MAX17048 | Fuel gauge (battery monitoring) |
| LDO/Regulator | 3.3V system power |

The power system supports:
- USB-C charging (5V input)
- Hardware charging LED indicator
- Precision battery percentage via I²C fuel gauge
- Deep sleep current < 100μA

### Display Interface

| Parameter | Value |
|-----------|-------|
| Display Type | TFT LCD |
| Resolution | 320 x 240 pixels |
| Color Depth | 16-bit (RGB565) |
| Interface | SPI |
| Backlight | PWM-controlled |

### User Inputs

| Input | Type | GPIO |
|-------|------|------|
| Left Encoder | Rotary + Push | GPIO 10, 11 |
| Right Encoder | Rotary + Push | GPIO 42, 41 |
| Left Shoulder | Momentary switch | GPIO 48 |
| Right Shoulder | Momentary switch | GPIO 1 |
| Under-Screen Left | Momentary switch | GPIO 38 |
| Under-Screen Center | Momentary switch | GPIO 39 |
| Under-Screen Right | Momentary switch | GPIO 40 |

!!! note
GPIO assignments shown are for v0.4 boards with PSRAM. Earlier v1.x boards use different pins for the left encoder (GPIO 35, 36) and LEDs (GPIO 37).

### Feedback Outputs

| Component | Type | GPIO |
|-----------|------|------|
| Status LEDs | WS2812B RGB (x3) | GPIO 12 |
| Buzzer | Piezoelectric | GPIO 2 |
| Vibration Motor | ERM motor | GPIO 47 |

### Expansion

| Connector | Interface | Purpose |
|-----------|-----------|---------|
| QWIIC | I²C | External sensors/peripherals |
| USB-C | USB 2.0 | Programming and charging |

## Schematic Sections

The schematic is organized into functional blocks:

| Section | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| Power | USB-C input, charging circuit, voltage regulation |
| MCU | ESP32-S3, crystal, reset, boot selection |
| Display | TFT LCD connector, backlight driver |
| Inputs | Rotary encoders, buttons, pull-up/pull-down resistors |
| Feedback | LED data line, buzzer driver, motor driver |
| Battery | MAX17048 fuel gauge, battery connector |
| Expansion | QWIIC connector, programming header |

## PCB Layout Considerations

### Component Placement

- **MCU** positioned centrally for balanced trace routing
- **USB-C** connector at board edge for accessibility
- **Display connector** oriented for ribbon cable routing to enclosure
- **Battery connector** positioned for internal battery placement
- **QWIIC connector** accessible for expansion modules

### Antenna Considerations

The ESP32-S3 uses an integrated PCB antenna or external antenna (version dependent). The antenna area should be kept clear of:
- Ground planes directly beneath
- Metal enclosure proximity
- High-frequency switching signals

!!! warning
Do not place components or route traces in the antenna keepout zone. This significantly degrades wireless performance.

!!! tip
Services like JLCPCB and PCBWay offer combined PCB fabrication and assembly. Upload the Gerbers and BOM for a turnkey solution.

### Critical Components

These components require careful attention during assembly:

| Component | Notes |
|-----------|-------|
| ESP32-S3 Module | Check orientation, ensure all pads are soldered |
| USB-C Connector | Requires precise alignment, check for shorts |
| MAX17048 | Small QFN package, needs proper reflow |
| WS2812B LEDs | Heat-sensitive, observe reflow profile |

## Version History

| Version | Changes |
|---------|---------|
| v0.4 | Current release with ESP32-S3 |

!!! note
Version v0.4 uses the ESP32-S3 variant. The "S3" suffix in the BOM filename indicates this variant.

## Troubleshooting

<AccordionGroup>
