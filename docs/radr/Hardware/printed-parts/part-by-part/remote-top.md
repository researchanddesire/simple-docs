## Function

The Top Housing is the main upper shell of the RADR wireless remote. This component:

- Houses the TFT display with a precision cutout for the screen
- Provides openings for the three tactile buttons
- Features mounting points for the rotary encoders (knobs)
- Contains windows for LED status indicators (optional transparent sections)
- Defines the primary ergonomic grip surface

## Print Settings

| Setting | Value |
|---------|-------|
| Layer Height | 0.12mm (for smooth curves) |
| Walls | 4 |
| Infill Type | Gyroid |
| Infill Percentage | 20-30% |
| Supports | Yes - significant supports needed |

!!! note
    The display cutout and internal features require substantial support material. For Bambu printers, the included 3MF file has optimized support settings.

!!! tip
    Print with the display opening facing up for best results on the visible surfaces.

## Multi-Color Printing (Optional)

The top housing includes separate bodies for multi-color printing:

| Area | Purpose | Recommended Material |
|------|---------|---------------------|
| Power indicator window | Shows charging LED | Transparent/translucent |
| Button status windows | Shows button backlighting | Transparent/translucent |
| Knob backlight rings | Shows encoder LED colors | Transparent/translucent |

!!! info
    Multi-color printing is purely aesthetic. The remote functions identically with single-color prints.
