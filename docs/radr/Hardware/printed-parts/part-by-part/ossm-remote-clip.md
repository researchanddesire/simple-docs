## Function

The OSSM Remote Clip allows you to mount the RADR wireless remote directly onto an OSSM aluminum extrusion frame. This component:

- Clips onto standard 2020/2040 aluminum extrusion profiles
- Provides a secure, removable mount for the remote
- Features a bottom-release mechanism for easy attachment/detachment
- Requires an M6x12 bolt for the clamping mechanism

## Print Settings

| Setting | Value |
|---------|-------|
| Layer Height | 0.16mm |
| Walls | 6 |
| Infill Type | Gyroid or Grid |
| Infill Percentage | 40%+ |
| Supports | Yes - Auto |

!!! warning
This part needs extra strength to handle repeated mounting and removal. Use more walls and higher infill than other parts.

!!! tip
PETG or ABS is recommended over PLA for better durability and fatigue resistance.

## Hardware Required

| Item | Quantity | Notes |
|------|----------|-------|
| M6x12mm bolt | 1 | Socket head or button head |
| M6 nut (optional) | 1 | Depending on clip design variant |

## Installation


### Step 1: Print the clip


  Print with increased wall count and infill for durability.

  !!! success
The clip is solid with no visible layer separation or weak spots.
  

### Step 2: Insert hardware


  Thread the M6x12 bolt into the clip's clamping mechanism.

  !!! tip
If threads are tight, run the bolt in and out a few times to clean them, or chase with an M6 tap.
  

### Step 3: Mount to extrusion


  Position the clip on the aluminum extrusion and tighten the bolt to clamp it in place.

  !!! warning
Don't overtighten—the plastic can crack. Tighten until secure, then stop.
  

### Step 4: Attach remote


  Slide or clip the RADR remote into the mounted clip.

  !!! success
Remote is secure and doesn't wobble or fall out during use.
  

## Troubleshooting

<AccordionGroup>
??? note "Clip doesn't fit extrusion snugly"

- Check that you're using standard 2020 or 2040 aluminum extrusion.
- Some printer tolerances may require scaling the model by ±1%.
- Lightly sand the inside surfaces for a better fit.

??? note "Clip cracks when tightening"

- Reduce clamping force.
- Reprint with more walls (8+) and higher infill (50%+).
- Use PETG or ABS instead of PLA.

??? note "Bolt threads strip"

- Use a metal M6 nut embedded in the clip (heat-set insert or press-fit).
- Chase threads with an M6 tap before use.
- Print with finer layer height for better thread definition.
