RADR provides visual, audio, and haptic feedback to communicate device state without requiring you to look at the screen.

## LED System

RADR has three RGB LEDs (WS2812B) positioned around the device:

| Position | Location | Primary Purpose |
|----------|----------|-----------------|
| LED 0 | Left encoder | Speed mode indicator |
| LED 1 | Middle | Connection/play state |
| LED 2 | Right encoder | Active mode indicator |

### LED Colors and Meanings

#### System States

| State | LED | Color | HSV Value | Brightness |
|-------|-----|-------|-----------|------------|
| Searching/Scanning | All | Blue | 150 | 255 (pulsing) |
| Idle (Main Menu) | All | Soft White | 180 | 50 |
| Device Connected | Middle | White | — | 50 |
| Paused/Stopped | Middle | Red | — | 255 |

#### OSSM Control Modes

When controlling an OSSM, the encoder LEDs indicate the active mode:

| Mode | LED | Color | Description |
|------|-----|-------|-------------|
| Speed | Left | Purple | Always active (speed is always controlled by left encoder) |
| Depth | Right | Coral/Red | Right encoder is adjusting depth |
| Sensation | Right | Blue | Right encoder is adjusting sensation |
| Stroke | Right | Green | Right encoder is adjusting stroke |

### LED Behavior Patterns

| Pattern | Meaning |
|---------|---------|
| Solid | Static state (connected, paused, etc.) |
| Pulsing | Active scan or searching |
| Quick flash | Feedback for button press or mode change |

## Buzzer Patterns

RADR uses a piezoelectric buzzer (GPIO 2) to provide audio feedback for key events.

### Boot Sound

**Pattern:** 4-note ascending sequence

| Note | Frequency | Duration |
|------|-----------|----------|
| 1 | 523 Hz (C5) | 100ms |
| 2 | 659 Hz (E5) | 100ms |
| 3 | 784 Hz (G5) | 100ms |
| 4 | 1047 Hz (C6) | 150ms |

Played when RADR powers on.

### Shutdown Sound

**Pattern:** 4-note descending sequence

| Note | Frequency | Duration |
|------|-----------|----------|
| 1 | 1047 Hz (C6) | 100ms |
| 2 | 784 Hz (G5) | 100ms |
| 3 | 659 Hz (E5) | 100ms |
| 4 | 523 Hz (C5) | 150ms |

Played when entering sleep mode.

### Device Connected

**Pattern:** 3-note ascending sequence

| Note | Frequency | Duration |
|------|-----------|----------|
| 1 | 1047 Hz (C6) | 80ms |
| 2 | 1319 Hz (E6) | 80ms |
| 3 | 1568 Hz (G6) | 120ms |

Played when successfully connecting to a device.

### Device Disconnected

**Pattern:** 3-note descending sequence

| Note | Frequency | Duration |
|------|-----------|----------|
| 1 | 1568 Hz (G6) | 80ms |
| 2 | 1319 Hz (E6) | 80ms |
| 3 | 1047 Hz (C6) | 120ms |

Played when a device disconnects.

### Paused

**Pattern:** Double beep

| Note | Frequency | Duration |
|------|-----------|----------|
| 1 | 800 Hz | 150ms |
| Gap | — | 100ms |
| 2 | 800 Hz | 150ms |

Played when pausing playback.

### Play/Resume

**Pattern:** Two-tone ascending

| Note | Frequency | Duration |
|------|-----------|----------|
| 1 | 1200 Hz | 100ms |
| 2 | 1400 Hz | 100ms |

Played when resuming playback.

### Mario Coin (Easter Egg)

**Pattern:** Classic coin sound

| Note | Frequency | Duration |
|------|-----------|----------|
| 1 | 2637 Hz (E7) | 80ms |
| 2 | 3136 Hz (G7) | 300ms |

Special feedback for certain interactions.

## Vibration Feedback

RADR includes a vibration motor (GPIO 47) for haptic feedback. Vibration patterns generally mirror buzzer patterns, providing tactile feedback that works without sound.

### Vibration Use Cases

| Event | Vibration |
|-------|-----------|
| Button press | Short pulse |
| Mode change | Quick vibration |
| Connection | Double vibration |
| Pause/Stop | Strong vibration |

### Vibration Pattern Timings

| Pattern | Description | Pulse Durations (ms) |
|---------|-------------|---------------------|
| Single Pulse | Quick tap feedback | 50 |
| Double Pulse | Confirmation feedback | 50, pause 200, 50 |
| Triple Pulse | Strong confirmation | 10, pause 50, 20, pause 50, 30 |
| Error Pulse | Long error indication | 500 |
| Shutdown | Descending pulses | 150, 100, 100, 100 |
| Device Connected | Ascending pulses | 100, 100, 150 |
| Device Disconnected | Descending pulses | 150, 100, 100 |
| Paused | Double pulse | 150, 150 |
| Play/Resume | Quick double pulse | 100, 100 |

!!! info
Vibration feedback helps you operate RADR by feel, especially useful in low-light or when the device is out of direct view.

## UI Color Scheme

RADR's display uses a consistent color scheme:

### Background Colors

| Element | Color Code | Description |
|---------|------------|-------------|
| Background | 0x10c5 | Dark gray (Gray 900) |
| Text Background | White | Primary text color |
| Secondary Text | 0xDEFB | Light gray |
| Disabled | 0x1082 | Very dark gray |

### OSSM Mode Colors

| Mode | Color Code | Color Name |
|------|------------|------------|
| Speed | 0x5013 | Royal Purple |
| Depth | 0xE186 | Warm Coral |
| Sensation | 0x3C9F | Ocean Blue |
| Stroke | 0x4E8A | Forest Green |

### State Colors

| State | Color |
|-------|-------|
| Active/Normal | White |
| Paused/Stopped | Red |
| Disabled | Dark Gray |
| Selected/Highlighted | Accent colors |

## Feedback Timing

| Event | Response Time |
|-------|---------------|
| Button press | < 10ms |
| Encoder change | < 10ms |
| Mode switch | < 50ms |
| LED color change | < 20ms |

## Tips for Using Feedback

!!! tip
Learn the buzzer sounds to operate RADR without looking. The connected sound (ascending) vs disconnected sound (descending) clearly indicates state.

!!! tip
The left LED (purple for speed) and right LED (mode color) tell you which parameter each encoder controls at a glance.

!!! tip
Red middle LED always means paused or stopped. White means active and ready.
